# Algorithms Playground

This is just where I store my code for (re-)learning algorithms and datastructures. Originally I started with https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms and did the assignments or related topics in Rust and Elm to see both more lower-level, systems approaches as well as high-level functional ones.
